# Covid-19-Data-Visualization-with-Tableau-main
This project provides interactive visualizations of global COVID-19 data using **Tableau**. It showcases key metrics like total cases, deaths, death rates, and infection percentages by continent and country. The data is queried using SQL and visualized using interactive dashboards.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Covid Data Visualization with Tableau_010925.sql`: SQL queries used for data extraction and transformation.
- `Dashboard 1_010925.png`: A Tableau dashboard visualizing:
  - Global numbers (cases, deaths, death percentage)
  - Total deaths per continent
  - Percent population infected per country (map)
  - Percent population infected over time (line graph)

- `Dashboard 2_010921.png`: An alternate Tableau dashboard with a different design theme and layout showing similar metrics.

### 📊 Global Metrics
- **Total Cases:** 446,723,043
- **Total Deaths:** 5,982,202
- **Death Percentage:** 1.34%

### 🌍 Deaths by Continent
- Highest in **Europe** (1.7M+ deaths)
- Followed by **North America** and **Asia**

### 📈 Percent Population Infected
- **Europe** shows the highest infection rate: **70.87%** as of June 2022
- Other continents like **Asia** remain significantly lower
## 🧠 SQL Queries Used

The following metrics were derived using SQL:
1. **Global Summary** – Total cases, total deaths, and death percentage
2. **Total Deaths per Continent**
3. **Country-level Infection Rates**
4. **Infection Rate Over Time per Country**
